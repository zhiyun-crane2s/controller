# 19/7/25: Brainstorming

Today I brainstormed about what features the box can have. Two knobs or one? Do I really need them separately or 
will one (with a toggle switch) do?

Well, I decided to go with two knobs, just in case I want to use the gimbal to perform more complex movement in the 
future.

One important thing about the knobs, I want them to have like a little spring like thingy that provides rotational
restoring force, so that the more you turn it left or right from its equilibrium position the more it wants to return.
Why? Because that allows for more precise control. More displacement from the equilibrium position = faster movement. 
And moving the knob by e.g. 15 degrees everytime is easier to do than rotating it at e.g. 120rpm consistently. 

I created a super rough 3d model. My first time properly using blender
